# Simple-KPI-Card
Looker Studio community visual

Show a metric and compare it to up to 50 other metrics.

Looker Studio's built in scorecard didn't used to allow you to compare arbitrary metrics. Since this was created they've updated it to allow some of the functionality of this custom visual.

The style is consistent with the built in scorecard but this one take ssome ideas from Power BI's KPI scorecard and a couple of extra features like an information overlay and text mode that are useful for KPI style dashboards.
